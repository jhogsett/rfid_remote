# Garage Door Activation Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the garage door activation functionality as specified in the Project Description.md:

**"When it detects three contiguous valid pulses 1000 ms apart, it sets pin 7 to HIGH for two seconds then back to LOW to activate the garage door opener"**

## Implementation Details

### New Constants Added
- `GARAGE_DOOR_PIN 7` - Pin used to activate garage door opener
- `PULSE_SEQUENCE_INTERVAL 1000` - Required 1000ms between pulses
- `PULSE_SEQUENCE_COUNT 3` - Need 3 contiguous pulses
- `GARAGE_DOOR_ACTIVE_TIME 2000` - Keep pin 7 HIGH for 2 seconds
- `PULSE_TIMING_TOLERANCE 200` - Allow ±200ms tolerance for timing

### New Data Structure
```cpp
typedef struct {
  unsigned long pulse_times[PULSE_SEQUENCE_COUNT];  // Timestamps of last pulses
  int pulse_count;                                  // Number of pulses detected in sequence
  bool garage_door_active;                         // Is garage door currently activated?
  unsigned long garage_door_start_time;           // When garage door activation started
  unsigned long last_valid_pulse_time;            // Timestamp of last valid pulse
} garage_door_state_t;
```

### New Functions Added

1. **`init_garage_door_state()`** - Initializes all garage door state variables
2. **`process_garage_door_sequence(unsigned long current_time_ms)`** - Processes each valid pulse to check if it's part of the 3-pulse sequence
3. **`update_garage_door_state(unsigned long current_time_ms)`** - Handles timing for garage door deactivation

### Key Features

1. **Pulse Sequence Detection**: Tracks up to 3 pulses and validates they are spaced approximately 1000ms apart (±200ms tolerance)

2. **Timing Validation**: Each pulse must occur within 800-1200ms of the previous pulse to be considered part of the sequence

3. **Automatic Reset**: If timing is incorrect, the sequence resets and starts counting from the current pulse

4. **Garage Door Activation**: When 3 valid pulses are detected:
   - Pin 7 is set HIGH immediately
   - Timer starts for 2-second duration
   - Serial output confirms activation

5. **Automatic Deactivation**: After 2 seconds, pin 7 is automatically set back to LOW

6. **Serial Debugging**: Detailed logging shows:
   - Pulse sequence progress (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.)
   - Garage door activation/deactivation events
   - Sequence resets due to timing issues

### Integration with Existing Code

The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing digital filter system:
- Uses the same `valid_pulse_detected` signal from the existing filter
- Maintains all existing functionality (LED indication, pulse width measurement, tuning interface)
- Adds garage door logic without disrupting existing debugging features

### Hardware Setup Required

1. Connect garage door relay/MOSFET driver to Arduino pin 7
2. Ensure proper power supply for relay activation
3. Connect relay output to garage door opener activation circuit

## Testing

The code has been successfully compiled and is ready for deployment. The existing serial debugging will help verify proper operation during testing.
